what is String?
> The string object is used to represent and manipulate sequence of character.

Description:
  > it is used to hold the data that can be represented in text form.

Creating string:

Strings can be created as primitives, from string literals, or as objects,
 

 let str1 ="A primitive";
 let arr2 = 'also a primitive';
 let arr3 = `yet another primitive`

using the String() constructor:

let str = new String("A string object")


character access
>There are two ways to access an individual character in a string. 
>The first is the charAt() method:
"cat". charAt(1)  // a

>The other way is to treat the string as an array-like object,
 where individual characters correspond to a numerical index:

 "cat"[1]


 String primitives and String objects:
 String literals (denoted by double or single quotes) and strings returned from String calls 
 in a non-constructor context (that is, called without using the new keyword) are primitive strings.
  In contexts where a method is to be invoked on a primitive string or a property lookup occurs, 
  JavaScript will automatically wrap the  string primitive and call the method or 
  perform the property lookup on the wrapper object instead.

  const foo = "foo";

console.log(typeof foo);
const strPrimitive1 = String(1)
console.log(typeof strPrimitive1);
const strPrimitive2 = String(true)
console.log(typeof strPrimitive2);

const objStr = new String(foo)
console.log(objStr, typeof objStr);
